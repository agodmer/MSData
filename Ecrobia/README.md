# Spectral data from "Proteomic fingerprinting discriminates cryptic gastropod species"

## Mass spectra corresponding five species of the genus *Ecrobia*

### Source and descritpion

- The raw data were downloaded from this  [link](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD019310).  This study uses 55 mass spectra from five species of the genus *Ecrobia* (*E. maritima*, E. spalatiana, *E. truncata*, *E. ventrosa*, *E. grimmi*).

- Mass spectra have been classified into 5 folders per species. A metadata file was created for the study example with the ```MSclassifR``` package.
