# Dataset of mass spectra for R

## Description and source
Mass spectra corresponding to the bacterial species *Klebsiella sp.* from The Robert Koch-Institute (RKI) database of microbial MALDI-TOF mass spectra corresponding to a list that contains 18 mass-spectra. The raw data were downloaded from this [link](https://zenodo.org/record/163517#.YIkWiNZuJCp) (1). The dataset focuses only on mass spectra from *Klebsiella sp.* (1).

## Details
The data was previously imported into the ```R``` environment and saved in a (KlebsiellaRKIspectra) ```.RData``` object that contains a 18 of class S4 corresponding each to a each mass-spectrum.  
The metadata of each mass-spectrum. was extracted and stored in a ```.RData``` object (KlebsiellaRKImetadata).
